	# Ionic-Angular-Spring-REST-Service
	There are 2 projects included here, one for the client and another for the backend.

	======= Back End ===========
	
	1.] The backend is developed using Java and Spring boot. The backend is a restful web service.
	2.] To test the code, I used Junit and Mockito to mock the sevices during unit testing of the controller. 
	3.] Use Spring tool suite to build and run the code. One should have maven isntalled if you wish to run the code without IDE.
	4.] To run the generated jar file, use java -jar <name of the jar fle>
	5.] An embedded tomcat will run once you run the application. By default tomcat will use the url http://localhost:8080/

	======= Front end ==========
	1.] The fron end is developed using Ionic framework and angularJS. 
	2.] Ionic framework is a framework for buidling mobile app using angularJs. It has a built-in cordova installed in it to
    	deploy application to a mobile device.
	3.] To test the codes, I used Karma and Jasmin.
	4.] To run the client app, one should have ionic CLI installed to execute ionic command lines.
	5.] Go to the app directory and type: ionic serve and the app should automatically show up in the browser.
	6.] By default ionic uses http://localhost:8100
